Hello, this is the Parental Resource Application I (Dylan Eversman) developed for River Valley MiddleSchool.
Along with the help of my group partner (Abiy Addis) we have created what is hopefully the first of many versions of this application.

This app is designed to be able to be run on any device utilizing Java, WITHOUT needing to download anything.

I am not a perfect programmer, so please excuse some of my naming, spacing, and formatting habits.

To run this application in an IDE or from the command line, please run either the MainClass.java or App.java
The .jar executable calls upon the MainClass.java file because IntelliJ IDEA didn't like it when I just had it use the App.java file

The Application is currently set to deliver the constructed email to "pknoebel@gccschools.com"
At the time of writing this message 5/5/2024, Paula Knoebel is the Office Clerk of River Valley Middle School
I believe that she is in charge of managing attendance, but confirmation should be acquired.

I may not be able to provide a lot more support, but should you need to contact me, I can be reached at: dylaneversman@gmail.com

The overall idea for this project was much more involved than what I alone was able to execute with this program.
Features that were mentioned during initial conception with the Vice Principal:
- Database with list of student ID numbers, users, and admins
- Authentication and proper login/logout system
- Proper implementation of calendar, possibly by using the API for the service the school currently uses (EventLink)
- Ability for parent's to directly send messages to specific members of the school's staff
- Bulletin Board Feature to allow parents to view specific information related to groups their student may be a part of
(i.e. All students, All 6th graders, Students of Mr./Mrs./Ms Teacher's classroom, Students on the swim team, etc.)

There may be more features that would be requested in the future, but this is the general roadmap as of now.

Be aware, for many of these features, the users would need to connect wirelessly to a server run by the school.
That is something that will need to be figured out at some point should this project be picked up again.

Good Luck, and Godspeed.
